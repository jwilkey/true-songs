    <div class="flex-one pad scrolly">
      <p>By uploading song/music files (henceforward referred to as ‘files’) to the True Songs website/app (henceforward referred to as ‘True Songs’), you are providing express and explicit permission to the True Songs owners (henceforward referred to as ‘the owners’) to stream this music on True Songs or any related apps/sites which have the True Songs name/logo.</p>

      <p>There is no guarantee implied or expressly given by the owners that any type of compensation/remuneration (financial or otherwise) will be given whatsoever upon upload of your files at any time, now and in the future.</p>

      <p>Therefore, by uploading your files, you are agreeing to having your files be streamed for free on True Songs or any related apps/sites which have the True Songs name/logo as per the discretion and direction of the owners.  This agreement lasts indefinitely.</p>

      <p>The owners agree, as much as within their power and ability, to not allow direct downloads within True Songs or any related apps/sites of any files uploaded by you without express permission provided by you in the future (using a different and/or additional permission document/agreement with different/additional text and permissions agreed upon).</p>

      <p>The owners are not responsible for any security breaches/lapses/exploits which may inadvertently occur on any of the True Songs sites/apps or related infrastructure which could lead to a malicious individual/group obtaining the ability to download the files directly (and thereby doing so).  In such occurrences, the owners are not responsible for any files being downloaded or used because of such a security breach/lapse/exploit and subsequent malicious actions.  Therefore, you are accepting the risk of the possibility of your files being downloaded if such a breach/lapse/exploit were to occur, with no responsibility accepted by the owners for any malicious acts pursued because they were made possible by these breaches/lapses/exploits.</p>

      <p>The owners are not responsible for any malicious usage of the True Songs site or related apps which could lead to compromise/sharing/dissemination of any files uploaded by you, or to the compromise/sharing/dissemination of any personal information or details about you.  We are also not responsible for the actual acts of compromise/sharing/dissemination or the malicious/unintended results thereof.</p>
